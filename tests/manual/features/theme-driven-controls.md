title: Theme — token scales drive the controls (E1)
---

The style controls derive their options from the SITE THEME (story #428) — no
hardcoded scales. This fixture ships its own tiny theme via the ```json fence
below (a fence with a `tokens`key is a theme; any other is policy): 4 font
sizes **including the invented`text-xxxxl`\*\*, a 3-color palette, one radius.
Compare with the main demo (no fixture), whose curated DEMO_THEME offers 5
sizes and 7 colors.

## Checks

- [ ] Select the paragraph → Font size offers exactly: sm, base, lg, **xxxxl** — the control GREW from the theme token.
- [ ] Color rows offer exactly 3 swatches (white, neutral-900, brand) — shrunk from the demo's 7.
- [ ] Pick xxxxl → the editing output carries `text-xxxxl`. (It renders unstyled for now — the class resolves when the CSS engine lands in E3; token membership is what E1 proves.)
- [ ] Pick lg → the paragraph visibly grows (`text-lg` is in the demo build's CSS).
- [ ] Pick brand as text color → output carries `text-brand` and the text turns blue.
- [ ] Border radius offers only `lg`.
- [ ] Reload without `?fixture=` → the main demo is back on its own theme (5 sizes, 7 colors).
