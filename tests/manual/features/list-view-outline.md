title: List view & outline
---

The left-rail document panel: the block tree flattened with collapse and
selection sync, and the Outline tab — stats plus Gutenberg's heading
structure checks.

## Checks

- [ ] The list-view button (top-left) opens the panel; rows mirror the document, nested blocks indented.
- [ ] Headings show their level icon and their text as an anchor preview.
- [ ] Collapse the Group row — its children prune from the list; expand restores them.
- [ ] Click a row — the block selects in the canvas; ⇧-click ranges, ⌘-click toggles (same gestures as the canvas).
- [ ] Collapse the Group, then select its child from the CANVAS — the tree un-collapses to reveal the highlight.
- [ ] Outline tab: character/word counts and reading time look sane and update as you type.
- [ ] The empty heading is flagged "(Empty heading)" with an amber chip.
- [ ] The H2 → H4 jump is flagged as an incorrect heading level.

  Skipped from H3 land… wait, from H2? Flag me if I skip.
